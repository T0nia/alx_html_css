This is a project that helps me to understand and put into practise, the building and designing of a website.
This website has two languages; HTML and CSS.
I have used both languages to the best of my abilities with the help of all the resources provided in my course.
This website is about smiling. You can learn how to smile when you look at the content of this website.
